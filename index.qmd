I am a statistician in the [Core Data Science Team](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science/) at [Meta](https://research.fb.com). I am working on experimentation-related statistical questions and causal inference.

I received my Ph.D. in [mathematics](http://math.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu), under [Will Fithian](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian). I focused on conditional inference and post-selection inference, as well as scientific replicability and mathematical statistics. My qualifying exam was on August 11 2016. The syllabus can be found here ([pdf](files/qual-syllabus.pdf), [tex](files/qual-syllabus.tex)).

Prior to the Ph.D., I completed a B.S. with honors in [mathematics](http://pma.caltech.edu/content/math) with a [computer science minor](http://www.cms.caltech.edu) at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu). I was born in Toronto, Ontario and spent my formative years in Hong Kong and California.

My résumé and my c.v. are available [here](files/resume.pdf) and [here](files/curriculum-vitae.pdf).
